# ar-debug-workbench
Augmented reality workbench for printed circuit board (PCB) debugging.

/ardw-plugin/ has the code for the KiCAD action plugin. To enable it, place the folder in the appropriate /scripting/plugins/ directory (see [IBOM's installation instructions](https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom/wiki/Installation) for details). To use it, open a project in EESchema and File>Plot all pages as svg into the folder ./ardw/ (must create the first time). Then, open the project in pcbnew and click the icon on the toolbar. Two json files will show up in the /ardw/ folder and the svgs will be updated. Copying these files to /ardw-app/data/ will allow the app to run with them.

/ardw-app/ has the code for the web application. The first time, you must run 'export FLASK_APP=application'. Any time you pull, you also need to refresh the python modules. If using a virtual environment (recommended), run './refresh_python_modules.sh'. Otherwise, manually install the necessary modules with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Now, the server can be started with 'python application.py' and accessed at http://localhost:5000 (NOTE: 'flask run' *will not* work anymore, because it does not support sockets). Optionally, you can specify a different port as the next argument (eg. 'python application.py 3000').

To compile the app into a unix executable, run 'pyinstaller -w -F --add-data "templates:templates" --add-data "static:static" application.py' from /ardw-app/. Ideally this is done from a virtual environment (or with as few modules as possible; see /ardw-app/requirements.txt), to keep the file size small. The executable 'application' will appear in /ardw-app/dist/ and can be run from the terminal (with a populated data/ folder in the same directory).
